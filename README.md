## General info
This CRUD app has the goal to help users to organize their job applications and their status through time. After the registration the user can  create a new application with some key information such as **position**, **company**, **location**, the **application status** and when the application was created. Once the application has been created it can be edited according to how the application is going or deleted. 
In the dashboard section the user can filter their applications to easily find the information they are looking for.
The process of authentication allows each user to have all the applications secured.
